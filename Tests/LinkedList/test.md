# Unit Tests for Linked List Implementations

This document describes the unit tests designed for the implementations of three types of linked lists: Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, and Circular Linked List. Unit tests are essential for ensuring that each component of the linked list functions correctly and behaves as expected.

## Purpose of Unit Tests

Unit tests are automated tests written and run by software developers to ensure that a section of an application (in this case, a linked list) behaves as intended. The primary goals of these tests include:

- Verifying that each operation (insert, delete, display) works correctly.
- Ensuring that the linked list maintains its integrity after operations are performed.
- Detecting regressions when changes are made to the codebase.

## Singly Linked List Unit Tests

### Test Cases
The unit tests for the singly linked list focus on the following functionalities:

1. **Insertion at the End:**
   - Test inserting multiple elements to ensure they are added correctly.
   - Verify that the list maintains the correct order of elements.

2. **Deletion of Nodes:**
   - Test deleting an existing node and check if it is removed.
   - Test attempting to delete a non-existing node to confirm that the list remains unchanged.

3. **Display Functionality:**
   - Validate that the display function accurately reflects the current state of the list.

### Implementation
The tests typically utilize assertions to compare the expected output with the actual results returned by the list operations. If any assertion fails, an error message is displayed indicating which test failed.

## Doubly Linked List Unit Tests

### Test Cases
The unit tests for the doubly linked list focus on the following functionalities:

1. **Insertion at the End:**
   - Test that new nodes are linked correctly both forward and backward.
   - Ensure that the order of elements is preserved.

2. **Deletion of Nodes:**
   - Test deleting a node from various positions (head, middle, tail) to ensure the previous and next pointers are updated accordingly.
   - Verify that attempting to delete a non-existent node does not alter the list.

3. **Display Functionality:**
   - Confirm that the display function returns the correct order of elements in the list, considering both directions.

### Implementation
Similar to the singly linked list tests, assertions are used to validate the expected outcomes against actual results for each operation.

## Circular Linked List Unit Tests

### Test Cases
The unit tests for the circular linked list cover the following functionalities:

1. **Insertion at the End:**
   - Test inserting nodes and ensure that the last node points back to the head, maintaining the circular structure.

2. **Deletion of Nodes:**
   - Test the deletion of various nodes, including the head, ensuring the circular nature is preserved after deletion.
   - Validate that the list remains unchanged when trying to delete a non-existent node.

3. **Display Functionality:**
   - Ensure that the display function can traverse the circular list without entering an infinite loop and returns the correct elements.

### Implementation
The tests for the circular linked list also use assertions to check for expected results and validate that the circular structure is correctly maintained throughout various operations.

## Conclusion

Unit tests play a crucial role in validating the functionality of linked list implementations. By covering various operations and edge cases for singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists, developers can ensure that their implementations are robust and reliable. This systematic testing approach helps in identifying bugs early in the development process and improves the overall quality of the code.
